# Medical PDF Documents
# ======================
# Place your medical PDF files in this directory.
# The chatbot will automatically load and index them.

# Example PDF topics:
# - Disease prevention guides
# - Medication information leaflets
# - Health and wellness articles
# - Medical reference materials
# - Treatment guidelines

# Supported formats: .pdf files

# To add a PDF:
# 1. Copy your PDF file to this directory
# 2. Rename it to something descriptive (e.g., "flu_guide.pdf")
# 3. Rebuild the vector database with: python medical_chatbot.py --rebuild

# Note: PDF files will be automatically loaded and processed
# when you run the chatbot for the first time or with --rebuild flag.
